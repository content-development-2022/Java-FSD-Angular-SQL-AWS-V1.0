What are Variables?

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

### **4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:**

-   Using var
-   Using let
-   Using const
-   Using nothing

## When to Use JavaScript var,const,let?

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.

If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:

### **Example**

const price1 = 5;  
const price2 = 6;  
let total = price1 + price2;  
**Example Explaination**

The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.

These are constant values and cannot be changed.

The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

This is a value that can be changed.
