\#\# HTML \*\*Contents\*\* \#\# What is HTML? - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages - HTML describes the structure of a Web page - HTML consists of a series of elements - HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content - HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. \#\# What is an HTML Element? - An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. \*\*Example:\*\* \\ Content goes here... \\ \\My First Heading\\ \\My first paragraph.\\ ![](media/a6473302efcff7a713c8f8067f12bf9a.png) \*\*Note:\*\* Some HTML elements have no content (like the \\ element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! \#\# Web Browsers The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly. A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document: ![](media/301cb611bdf900926178178057003ee4.png) \#\# HTML Page Structure Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure: ![](media/f765ad73dae353a793d56821a5d51d6f.png) \*\*Note:\*\* The content inside the \\ section (the white area above) will be displayed in a browser.
