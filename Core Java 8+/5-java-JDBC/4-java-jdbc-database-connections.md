# 1. JDBC - Database Connections

-   After you've installed the appropriate driver, it is time to establish a database connection using JDBC.
-   The programming involved to establish a JDBC connection is fairly simple.

**Steps** :

**Step-1: Import JDBC Packages**:

-   Add **import** statements to your Java program to import required classes in your Java code.

**Step 2: Register JDBC Driver**:

-   This step causes the JVM to load the desired driver implementation into memory so it can fulfill your JDBC requests.

**Step 3: Database URL Formulation**:

-   This is to create a properly formatted address that points to the database to which you wish to connect.

**Step 4: Create Connection Object**:

-   Finally, code a call to the *DriverManager* object's *getConnection( )* method to establish actual database connection.

## 1.1 Import JDBC Packages

-   The **Import** statements tell the Java compiler where to find the classes you reference in your code and are placed at the very beginning of your source code.
-   To use the standard JDBC package, which allows you to select, insert, update, and delete data in SQL tables, add the following *imports* to your source code âˆ’

```java
import java.sql.* ; // for standard JDBC programs
import java.math.* ; // for BigDecimal and BigInteger support
```

## 1.2 Register JDBC Driver

-   You must register the driver in your program before you use it.
-   Registering the driver is the process by which the Oracle driver's class file is loaded into the memory, so it can be utilized as an implementation of the JDBC interfaces.
-   You need to do this registration only once in your program. You can register a driver in one of two ways.

### 1.2.1 Approach I - Class.forName()

-   The most common approach to register a driver is to use Java's **Class.forName()** method, to dynamically load the driver's class file into memory, which automatically registers it.
-   This method is preferable because it allows you to make the driver registration configurable and portable.
-   The following example uses Class.forName( ) to register the Oracle driver

```java
try {
    Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
}
catch(ClassNotFoundException ex) {
    System.out.println("Error: unable to load driver class!");
    System.exit(1);
}
```

-   You can use **getInstance()** method to work around noncompliant JVMs, but then you'll have to code for two extra Exceptions as follows

```java
try {
    Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver").newInstance();
}
catch(ClassNotFoundException ex) {
    System.out.println("Error: unable to load driver class!");
    System.exit(1);
catch(IllegalAccessException ex) {
    System.out.println("Error: access problem while loading!");
    System.exit(2);
catch(InstantiationException ex) {
    System.out.println("Error: unable to instantiate driver!");
    System.exit(3);
}
```

### 1.2.2 Approach II - DriverManager.registerDriver()

-   The second approach you can use to register a driver, is to use the static **DriverManager.registerDriver()** method.
-   You should use the *registerDriver()* method if you are using a non-JDK compliant JVM, such as the one provided by Microsoft.
-   The following example uses registerDriver() to register the Oracle driver

```java
try {
    Driver myDriver = new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver();
    DriverManager.registerDriver( myDriver );
}
catch(ClassNotFoundException ex) {
    System.out.println("Error: unable to load driver class!");
    System.exit(1);
}
```

## 1.3 Database URL Formulation

-   After you've loaded the driver, you can establish a connection using the **DriverManager.getConnection()** method.
-   For easy reference, let me list the three overloaded DriverManager.getConnection() methods
1.  getConnection(String url)
2.  getConnection(String url, Properties prop)
3.  getConnection(String url, String user, String password)
-   Here each form requires a database **URL**.
-   A database URL is an address that points to your database.
-   Formulating a database URL is where most of the problems associated with establishing a connection occurs.
-   Following table lists down the popular JDBC driver names and database URL.

| **RDBMS** | **JDBC driver name**            | **URL format**                                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| MySQL     | com.mysql.jdbc.Driver           | \*\*jdbc:mysql://\*\*hostname/ databaseName                 |
| ORACLE    | oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver | \*\*jdbc:oracle:thin:@\*\*hostname:port Number:databaseName |
| DB2       | COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.net.DB2Driver  | \*\*jdbc:db2:\*\*hostname:port Number/databaseName          |
| Sybase    | com.sybase.jdbc.SybDriver       | \*\*jdbc:sybase:Tds:\*\*hostname: port Number/databaseName  |

-   All the highlighted part in URL format is static and you need to change only the remaining part as per your database setup.

## 1.4 Create Connection Object

-   We have listed down three forms of **DriverManager.getConnection()** method to create a connection object.

## 1.4.1 Using a Database URL with a username and password

-   The most commonly used form of getConnection() requires you to pass a database URL, a *username*, and a *password*
-   Assuming you are using Oracle's **thin** driver, you'll specify a host:port:databaseName value for the database portion of the URL.
-   If you have a host at TCP/IP address 192.0.0.1 with a host name of amrood, and your Oracle listener is configured to listen on port 1521, and your database name is EMP, then complete database URL would be

```java
jdbc:oracle:thin:@amrood:1521:EMP
```

-   Now you have to call getConnection() method with appropriate username and password to get a **Connection** object as follows

```java
String URL = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@amrood:1521:EMP";
String USER = "username";
String PASS = "password"
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASS);
```

## 1.4.2 Using Only a Database URL

-   A second form of the DriverManager.getConnection( ) method requires only a database URL

```java
DriverManager.getConnection(String url);
```

-   However, in this case, the database URL includes the username and password and has the following general form

```java
jdbc:oracle:driver:username/password@database
```

-   So, the above connection can be created as follows

```java
String URL = "jdbc:oracle:thin:username/password@amrood:1521:EMP";
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(URL);
```

## 1.4.3 Using a Database URL and a Properties Object

-   A third form of the DriverManager.getConnection( ) method requires a database URL and a Properties object

```java
DriverManager.getConnection(String url, Properties info);
```

-   A Properties object holds a set of keyword-value pairs. It is used to pass driver properties to the driver during a call to the getConnection() method.
-   To make the same connection made by the previous examples, use the following code

```java
import java.util.*;
String URL = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@amrood:1521:EMP";
Properties info = new Properties( );
info.put( "user", "username" );
info.put( "password", "password" );
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, info);
```

# 2. Closing JDBC Connections

-   At the end of your JDBC program, it is required explicitly to close all the connections to the database to end each database session.
-   However, if you forget, Java's garbage collector will close the connection when it cleans up stale objects.
-   Relying on the garbage collection, especially in database programming, is a very poor programming practice.
-   You should make a habit of always closing the connection with the close() method associated with connection object.
-   To ensure that a connection is closed, you could provide a 'finally' block in your code.
-   A *finally* block always executes, regardless of an exception occurs or not.
-   To close the above opened connection, you should call close() method as follows

```java
conn.close();
```

-   Explicitly closing a connection conserves DBMS resources, which will make your database administrator happy.
