# 1. File Handling in Java

-   In Java, with the help of File Class, we can work with files.
-   This File Class is inside the java.io package.
-   The File class can be used by creating an object of the class and then specifying the name of the file.

## 1.1 Why File Handling is Required?

-   File Handling is an integral part of any programming language as file handling enables us to store the output of any particular program in a file and allows us to perform certain operations on it.
-   In simple words, file handling means reading and writing data to a file.

**Example:**

```java
// Importing File Class
import java.io.File;
class Sample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // File name specified
        File obj = new File("myfile.txt");
        System.out.println("File Created!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
File Created!
```

-   In Java, the concept Stream is used in order to perform I/O operations on a file.
-   So at first, let us get acquainted with a concept known as Stream in Java.

# 2. Streams in Java

-   In Java, a sequence of data is known as a stream.
-   This concept is used to perform I/O operations on a file.
-   There are two types of streams : input stream and output stream.

## 2.1 Input Stream

-   The Java InputStream class is the superclass of all input streams.
-   The input stream is used to read data from numerous input devices like the keyboard, network, etc.
-   InputStream is an abstract class, and because of this, it is not useful by itself.
-   However, its subclasses are used to read data.

**There are several subclasses of the InputStream class, which are as follows:**

1.  AudioInputStream
2.  ByteArrayInputStream
3.  FileInputStream
4.  FilterInputStream
5.  StringBufferInputStream
6.  ObjectInputStream

### 2.1.1 Creating an InputStream

**Example:**

```java
// Creating an InputStream
InputStream obj = new FileInputStream();
```

-   Here, an input stream is created using FileInputStream.

**Note:** We can create an input stream from other subclasses as well as InputStream.

### 2.1.2 Methods of InputStream

| **S No.** | **Method**           | **Description**                                                                   |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | read()               | Reads one byte of data from the input stream.                                     |
| 2         | read(byte[] array)() | Reads byte from the stream and stores that byte in the specified array.           |
| 3         | mark()               | It marks the position in the input stream until the data has been read.           |
| 4         | available()          | Returns the number of bytes available in the input stream.                        |
| 5         | markSupported()      | It checks if the mark() method and the reset() method is supported in the stream. |
| 6         | reset()              | Returns the control to the point where the mark was set inside the stream.        |
| 7         | skips()              | Skips and removes a particular number of bytes from the input stream.             |
| 8         | close()              | Closes the input stream.                                                          |

## 2.2 Output Stream

-   The output stream is used to write data to numerous output devices like the monitor, file, etc.
-   OutputStream is an abstract superclass that represents an output stream.
-   OutputStream is an abstract class and because of this, it is not useful by itself.
-   However, its subclasses are used to write data.

**There are several subclasses of the OutputStream class which are as follows:**

1.  ByteArrayOutputStream
2.  FileOutputStream
3.  StringBufferOutputStream
4.  ObjectOutputStream
5.  DataOutputStream
6.  PrintStream

### 2.2.1 Creating an OutputStream

**Example:**

```java
// Creating an OutputStream
OutputStream obj = new FileOutputStream();
```

-   Here, an output stream is created using FileOutputStream.

**Note:** We can create an output stream from other subclasses as well as OutputStream.

### 2.2.2 Methods of OutputStream

| **S. No.** | **Method**          | **Description**                                                              |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.         | write()             | Writes the specified byte to the output stream.                              |
| 2.         | write(byte[] array) | Writes the bytes which are inside a specific array to the output stream.     |
| 3.         | close()             | Closes the output stream.                                                    |
| 4.         | flush()             | Forces to write all the data present in an output stream to the destination. |

# 3. File Stream based on the data type

-   Based on the data type, there are two types of streams :

## 3.1 Byte Stream

-   This stream is used to read or write byte data.
-   The byte stream is again subdivided into two types which are as follows:

**1) Byte Input Stream:** Used to read byte data from different devices.

**2) Byte Output Stream:** Used to write byte data to different devices.

## 3.2 Character Stream

-   This stream is used to read or write character data.
-   Character stream is again subdivided into 2 types which are as follows:

**1) Character Input Stream:** Used to read character data from different devices.

**2) Character Output Stream:** Used to write character data to different devices.

-   Owing to the fact that you know what a stream is, letâ€™s polish up File Handling in Java by further understanding the various methods that are useful for performing operations on the files like creating, reading, and writing files.

# 4. Java File Class Methods

-   The following table depicts several File Class methods:

| **Method Name**       | **Description**                                 | **Return Type** |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **canRead()**         | It tests whether the file is readable or not.   | Boolean         |
| **canWrite()**        | It tests whether the file is writable or not.   | Boolean         |
| **createNewFile()**   | It creates an empty file.                       | Boolean         |
| **delete()**          | It deletes a file.                              | Boolean         |
| **exists()**          | It tests whether the file exists or not.        | Boolean         |
| **length()**          | Returns the size of the file in bytes.          | Long            |
| **getName()**         | Returns the name of the file.                   | String          |
| **list()**            | Returns an array of the files in the directory. | String[]        |
| **mkdir()**           | Creates a new directory.                        | Boolean         |
| **getAbsolutePath()** | Returns the absolute pathname of the file.      | String          |
