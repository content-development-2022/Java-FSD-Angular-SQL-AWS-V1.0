1.  The most basic control flow statement supported by the Java programming language is the \__\_ statement.
2.  The \__\_ statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
3.  The \_*\_ statement is similar to the while statement, but evaluates its expression at the \_*\_ of the loop.
4.  How do you write an infinite loop using the for statement?
5.  How do you write an infinite loop using the while statement?
6.  How Can You Exit From a Loop?
7.  Consider the following code.

if (aNumber \>= 0)

if (aNumber == 0)

System.out.println("first string");

else System.out.println("second string");

System.out.println("third string");

a) What output do you think the code will produce if aNumber is 3?

b) Using only spaces and line breaks, reformat the code snippet to make the control flow easier to understand.

c) Use braces, { and }, to further clarify the code.
