CSS Selectors

A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

## **CSS Selectors**

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

-   Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
-   [Combinator selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp) (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
-   [Pseudo-class selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) (select elements based on a certain state)
-   [Pseudo-elements selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) (select and style a part of an element)
-   [Attribute selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp) (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

## **The CSS element Selector**

The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

## **The CSS id Selector**

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (\#) character, followed by the id of the element.

**Note:** An id name cannot start with a number!

## **The CSS class Selector**

The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

### **Example**

In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:

### **Example**

In this example only \<p\> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:

HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

### **Example**

In this example the \<p\> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large":

## **The CSS Universal Selector**

The universal selector (\*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

### **Example**

The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page:

The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

h1 {  
 text-align: center;  
 color: red;  
}  
  
h2 {  
 text-align: center;  
 color: red;  
}  
  
p {  
 text-align: center;  
 color: red;  
}It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

### **Example**

In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above:
