Git – Group activity

Activity name: Git Collaboration - Basic

Team size: 3

Purpose of the activity: To understand how to collaborate and contribute code to a project using git within a team.

Requirements: Github account, Git installed in local, an IDE to work with the project

How to execute:

-   Let’s call the team members as Member1, Member2, Member3 and let Member1 be the person responsible for managing/creating/merging the repository in github.
-   First, Member1 should create an organization called git-exercises in their github account.
-   Next, Member1 should create a repository(can be private or public) called practice-git-with-java
-   Member 1 should add Member2 and Member3 as collaborators to this repository practice-git-with-java. By doing so Member1 and Member2 will be able to contribute code to the repository created in this organization. And Member1 by default will be able to contribute to the repository as he/she will be the owner.
-   Now Member1 should share the repository link with Member2 and Member3.
-   Now Member2 and Member3 can clone the project to their local computer. Member1 should also clone the project to his/her local computer.
-   And all members can import the project into eclipse.
-   Now any one member lets say Member3 can finish one of the java assignment listed below and push the code to the remote repository.
-   Now all the members can see the java assignment completed by Member3 in the remote repository but the local repository of Member2 and Member1 does not reflect the changes pushed to remote repository by Member3. For this, Member2 and Member1 should pull the code from the remote repository to bring it to their local repository. Now in Member2 and Member1’s respective eclipse, the java assignment(completed by Member3) will be visible.
-   Likewise the other 2 members(Member2 and Member1) can repeat the same steps one after the other.
-   Finally we should be able to see 3 java assignments completed by the 3 team members in the remote repository.

Further exploration:

-   What if all the team members work with their own java assignment simultaneously and push the code? Will it be successful? Or will it show an error? If so how do we fix it?
-   The git commands required for the above steps would have been completed in GitBash. How would it be if we do in through GithHub Desktop? Easy? Difficult? Same?
