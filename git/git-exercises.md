How to execute:

-   First, Member1 should create an organization called git-exercises in their github account.
-   Member 1 should add Member2 and Member3 as collaborators to this organization. By doing so Member1 and Member2 will be able to contribute code to repositories created in this organization. And Member1 by default will be able to contribute to the repositories as he/she will be the owner.
